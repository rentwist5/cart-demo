# Cart Demo
Weekend Demonstration of a Simple Cart

This shopping cart demo was created for a marketing and acquisition company as part of the interview process for a development manager role to demonstrate an understanding of the technology used. As it was built over a weekend, it is very basic in its implementation. Please note that typical considerations such as SEO, performance, scalability, usage metrics, A/B testing, and browser testing were not factored into this demo.
